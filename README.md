It's a game where you get random lyrics that are missing some words,
and you must guess the right lyrics out of multiple presented options.

You can also compete with a friend who will guess more lyrics with a time limit.

Spent a night making this. Really wish I could make a good-looking design.
The code is a bit messy since I made it at night while being sleepy, but it works.

Has some small bugs here and there.

Needs a database to run. Takes data from an API, but I couldn't find any good free ones.
So I just quickly set up a database and fed lyrics to my app from localhost.

Maybe will add some way to make it work without the database, or make it into a full-stack app,
that has its own database.
